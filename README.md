# The Mans Guide to overcoming depression
First of all, the first step is to accept you have a mental illness. I fought this harddd. I found myself going to the doctors office often, digestive issues (Gastritis)  and skin problems (doctors all had different opinons of the skin conditions which none of the medications had any effect).

# Introduction
Looking for resources on the internet, I was unable to find a good strategy to overcoming depression. Now that I know I have depression, it is making it easier to understand my behaviours of the past and identify a path forward. I want to document what may be a more straight forward solution to overcoming depression.  

Most of the self help ressources out there were vague and did not provide a clear path to recovery. Diet, routine and understand the source of your depression will move you forward in overcoming this monster.

# Goals
First and foremost is to overcome depression! 

It is extremely important to have a set of clear goals in order to acheive to grand goal. Even small goals will force you to manifest change in yourself.

- lose weight
- quit smoking

And a more indirect goal: Be the sholder

# Signs and Symptoms
My culture in Noterhn Ontario (Sudbury), Canada heavily stigmatized depression and mental illnes. Despite many attempts from my wife that I had a mental illness (bipolar, split personality...which I was epicly offended by) I ignored them and deceived myself that it was just related to martital issues and difficulties in communication.

# Diet
This diet was suggested by Dr. Jordan Peterson. Original can be found here: https://mikhailapeterson.com/2016/12/07/the-list/

## Meats
- turkey
- beef
- chicken
- lamb
- duck
- wild game is fine too, elk, moose, etc.
- wild salmon
- tuna – check the ingredients! Get stuff that’s just tuna and water and perhaps salt.
- organ meat – chicken liver tastes the best I find
- wild herring – check the ingredients!
- wild sardines – check the ingredients!

## Veggies
- lettuce
- arugula
- arugula microgreens (arugula sprouts)
- cucumber
- swiss chard
- seaweed –check the ingredients! this is hard to find without soy and other things. The brand I’ve linked to is safe and really tasty
- cilantro
- collard greens
- broccoli
- turnips
- cauliflower
- parsnips
- sweet potatoes
- spinach

## Fruit
- olives – check the ingredients! see my olive post. be super careful about which brands you buy here too, many have preservatives and flavours and dyes.

## Vinegars
- applice cider

## Oils:
- coconut oil – get unrefined. And try to avoid the Nutiva brand. It’s everywhere but it doesn’t taste as good, and I’ve had ones that have gone bad before.
- olive oil – make sure your olive oil is pure olive oil. Sometimes it’s also soybean oil!

## Spices/Seasonings
- salt
- pepper
- marjoram
- parsley
- oregano
- thyme
- rosemary
- peppermint
- turmeric
- basil
- bay leaf
- coriander

## Beverages
- peppermint tea – check the ingredients. buy loose leaf (David’s sells an organic peppermint which is lovely) or organic. We want to make sure there aren’t preservatives or flavours added. White tea bags or coffee filters are often bleached with sulfites. If you’re super sensitive (dad and I), you’ll react to these. So make sure you get organic tea bags as well!
- black tea- check the ingredients. buy loose leaf if possible
- green tea- check the ingredients. buy loose leaf if possible

## Alcohol 
Setup times when it's ok to consume. A good guideline is to not consume alcohol for the first month. 
- vodka (ice tea, fruits)
- bourbon & whiskey (water and ice)
- ?

## Marijuana
The so called "weed hangover" has returned. I haven't experienced it since high school.
- Indica so far seems find (mild morning "hangover")

# Sleep
You need a regular sleep routine. In bed before midnight at minimum. Awake @ 7.

## Can't sleep?
- not sure yet...

# Hygene
- brush your teeth twice a day 
- Shower atleast once a day
- Do not avoid going to the doctor (untreated hemeroids...ya fun right, lol)
- Take pride in how you look (New clothes that fit, comfortable shoes, try to look good generally.)

# Schedule & Routine
Structure and routine are very important in overcoming depression.
- takes your mind of events/issues that may be inducing an episode.
- creates healthy habbits

# Fitness
You <b>NEED</b> a fitness routine. The benefits of this will become clear.

##Ideas
- bike riding
- MMA
- hockey
- football
- tenis
- PICK A SPORT! or 2...

# Mariage
- Plan a vacation (do everything, treat her)
- Flatter her (hey beautiful, gorgeous)
- Take her to dinner ... plan dates (sushi,keg..gotta keep in line with the diet)
- Buy her stuff....flowers shoes jewlery. (Know her size :) Get her sexy stuff hehe langerie?)
- Spa day (you set it up for her)
- Tell her you love her

## Apology
You may have acted out in many awful ways and your partner likely expects you to offer a sincere apology.

Ideas?

## Communication
I haven't figured this one out yet.
## Intimacy
I need to show my wife more love! Do special things for her.

# Managing anger
As a married man, anger and depression is a big issue for me. When conflict between me and my wife arises, I find it difficult to snap.

# Drugs & Alcohol
Alcohol certainly exagerate feelings of anger.
