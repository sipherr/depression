# The Mans Guide to overcoming depression
The first step is to <b>acknoledge you have a mental illness</b>. 

This task can be exceedingly difficult for most men. We do not want to accept any perceived weakness from our peers. Let me tell you, your weaknesses will shine when your wife leaves, you are broke or some other catostrophic event comes at the hands of your poor choices.

I found myself going to the doctors office often, digestive issues (Gastritis)  and skin problems (doctors all had different opinons of the skin conditions which none of the medications had any effect). Disorder and chaos (do you clean your living area? do you neglect doing laundry?) bread depression. My life was full of it.

# Journal

In order to keep structure in your life.

My personal journal...I'll leave some of here so anyone else can structure based on this. Bascily I keep track of whats up for tomorrow and anything that can be added to the "Tomorrow" plan. Keep a list of bigger tasks and tackle them according to your schedule.

## Tomorrow
- Goto the dump
- Hair cut
- get chain fixed
- Sea doo ride and bike ride? We will see

## Oher List of things to do

- Install bike rack (maybe replace the hinges?)
- Install light fixtures outside (only had them for 3 years you lazy fuck)
- Properlly mount the security cameras (no half assed install)
- Bathroom renovations upstairs (You figure it out. Don't leave it on Victoria)
- Backyard / front yard renovations (This is your man project)
- Finish the walls / storage in the garage (another one...)

# Introduction
Through my personal journey looking for resources on the internet in regards to depression, I was unable to find a good strategy to help over this thing that I have lived with for so long. Now that I know I have depression, it is making it easier to understand my behaviours of the past and identify a path forward. I want to document what may be a more straight forward solution to overcoming depression for others *<b>this may not work for everyone!</b>*

Most of the self help ressources out there were vague and did not provide a clear path to recovery. Diet, routine and understand the source of your depression will move you forward in overcoming this monster.

# Goals
First and foremost, your main goal is to overcome depression! It is not an easy task and will require major changes in your day to day life.

It is extremely important to have a set of clear goals in order to acheive to grand goal. Even small goals will force you to manifest change in yourself.

- Lose weight
- Quit smoking
- Save money for something you want
- Get some friends nearby! 

It is also important to have more "abstracted" goals such as
- Be an emotional support during a family crisis
- The shoulder to cry on at a funeral
- Be reliable for family and friends

# Signs and Symptoms
My culture in Nothern Ontario (Sudbury), Canada heavily stigmatized depression and mental illnes. Despite many attempts from my wife to communicate that I had a mental illness (bipolar, split personality...which I was epicly offended by) I ignored any offer for help and deceived myself that it was just related to martital issues and difficulties in communication. I was pushing the problems on her when in reality it was me all along. Maybe, she has some things to work on but she clearly has it more together than me.

I'm not a doctor but I feel if the bottom half (men) applies to you, then you likely have depression.

Like women with depression, men with depression may:

- Feel sad, hopeless or empty
- Feel extremely tired
- Have difficulty sleeping or sleep too much
- Not get pleasure from activities usually enjoyed

Other behaviors in men that could be signs of depression — but not recognized as such — include:

- Escapist behavior, such as spending a lot of time at work or on sports
- Physical symptoms, such as headaches, digestive problems and pain
- Problems with alcohol or drug use
- Controlling, violent or abusive behavior
- Irritability or inappropriate anger
- Risky behavior, such as reckless driving
- Nail biting, figiting (which are lso signs of other mental illnesses)

# Diet
This diet was suggested by Dr. Jordan Peterson. Original can be found here: https://mikhailapeterson.com/2016/12/07/the-list/

## Meats
- turkey
- beef
- chicken
- lamb
- duck
- wild game is fine too, elk, moose, etc.
- wild salmon
- tuna – check the ingredients! Get stuff that’s just tuna and water and perhaps salt.
- organ meat – chicken liver tastes the best I find
- wild herring – check the ingredients!
- wild sardines – check the ingredients!

## Veggies
- lettuce
- arugula
- arugula microgreens (arugula sprouts)
- cucumber
- swiss chard
- seaweed –check the ingredients! this is hard to find without soy and other things. The brand I’ve linked to is safe and really tasty
- cilantro
- collard greens
- broccoli
- turnips
- cauliflower
- parsnips
- sweet potatoes
- spinach

## Fruit
- olives – check the ingredients! see my olive post. be super careful about which brands you buy here too, many have preservatives and flavours and dyes.

## Vinegars
- applice cider

## Oils:
- coconut oil – get unrefined. And try to avoid the Nutiva brand. It’s everywhere but it doesn’t taste as good, and I’ve had ones that have gone bad before.
- olive oil – make sure your olive oil is pure olive oil. Sometimes it’s also soybean oil!

## Spices/Seasonings
- salt
- pepper
- marjoram
- parsley
- oregano
- thyme
- rosemary
- peppermint
- turmeric
- basil
- bay leaf
- coriander

## Beverages
- peppermint tea – check the ingredients. buy loose leaf (David’s sells an organic peppermint which is lovely) or organic. We want to make sure there aren’t preservatives or flavours added. White tea bags or coffee filters are often bleached with sulfites. If you’re super sensitive (dad and I), you’ll react to these. So make sure you get organic tea bags as well!
- black tea- check the ingredients. buy loose leaf if possible
- green tea- check the ingredients. buy loose leaf if possible

## Alcohol 
Setup times when it's ok to consume. A good guideline is to not consume alcohol for the first month. 
- vodka (ice tea, fruits)
- bourbon & whiskey (water and ice)
- ?

## Marijuana
The so called "weed hangover" has returned. I haven't experienced it since high school.
- Indica so far seems find (mild morning "hangover")

# Sleep
You need a regular sleep routine. In bed before midnight at minimum. Awake @ 7.

## Can't sleep?
- not sure yet...

# Hygene
- brush your teeth twice a day 
- Shower atleast once a day
- Do not avoid going to the doctor (untreated hemeroids...ya fun right, lol)
- Take pride in how you look (New clothes that fit, comfortable shoes, try to look good generally.)

# Schedule & Routine
Structure and routine are very important in overcoming depression.
- takes your mind of events/issues that may be inducing an episode.
- creates healthy habbits

# Fitness
You <b>NEED</b> a fitness routine. The benefits of this will become clear. Physically and mentally your require some activity.

## Ideas
- bike riding
- MMA
- hockey
- football
- tenis
- PICK A SPORT! or 2...

# Mariage
This one men have trouble with.
- Plan a vacation (do everything, treat her)
- Flatter her (hey beautiful, gorgeous)
- Take her to dinner ... plan dates (sushi,keg..gotta keep in line with the diet)
- Buy her stuff....flowers shoes jewlery. (Know her size :) Get her sexy stuff hehe langerie?)
- Spa day (you set it up for her)
- Tell her you love her

## Apologize
You may have acted out in many awful ways and your partner likely expects you to offer a sincere apology. "I'm sorry" just won't cut it. You need to tell her you understand that you are the problem.

- Buy the biggest most beautiful bouquet of flowers you can afford
- Take her on a special dinner

## Communication
I haven't figured this one out yet...Here's something I know helps.

When things get heated...communicate via email. This seems very effective for us. It allows more expression vs using txt messages on mobile (avoid using phone calls / in person communications).

## Intimacy
I need to show my wife more love! Do special things for her.

# Managing anger
As a married man, anger and depression is a big issue for me. When conflict between me and my wife arises, I find it difficult to snap.

# Drugs & Alcohol
Alcohol certainly exagerate feelings of anger.
