# Introduction
Now that I know I have depression I want to document what may be a more straight forward solution to overcoming depression.


- STRUCTURE (everything on schedule...dishes..laundry... etc)
- quit smoking
- limit drugs and alchol

# Signs and Symptoms
My culture in Noterhn Ontario (Sudbury), Canada heavily stigmatized depression and mental illnes. Despite many attempts from my wife that I had a mental illness (bipolar, split personality...which I was epicly offended by) I ignored them and deceived myself that it was just related to martital issues and difficulties in communication.

# Diet
This diet was suggested by Dr. Jordan Peterson.

## Meats
turkey
beef
chicken
lamb
duck
wild game is fine too, elk, moose, etc.
wild salmon
tuna – check the ingredients! Get stuff that’s just tuna and water and perhaps salt.
organ meat – chicken liver tastes the best I find
wild herring – check the ingredients!
wild sardines – check the ingredients!

## Veggies

lettuce
arugula
arugula microgreens (arugula sprouts)
cucumber
swiss chard
seaweed –check the ingredients! this is hard to find without soy and other things. The brand I’ve linked to is safe and really tasty
cilantro
collard greens
broccoli
turnips
cauliflower
parsnips
sweet potatoes
spinach

## Fruit

olives – check the ingredients! see my olive post. be super careful about which brands you buy here too, many have preservatives and flavours and dyes.
Vinegars:

apple cider vinegar – try to get the organic stuff so there aren’t dyes and flavours added
Oils:

coconut oil – get unrefined. And try to avoid the Nutiva brand. It’s everywhere but it doesn’t taste as good, and I’ve had ones that have gone bad before.
olive oil – make sure your olive oil is pure olive oil. Sometimes it’s also soybean oil!
Spices/Seasonings

salt
pepper
marjoram
parsley
oregano
thyme
rosemary
peppermint
turmeric
basil
bay leaf
coriander
Other:

baking soda (probably won’t eat this but it’s good for toothpaste 🙂 )
peppermint tea – check the ingredients. buy loose leaf (David’s sells an organic peppermint which is lovely) or organic. We want to make sure there aren’t preservatives or flavours added. White tea bags or coffee filters are often bleached with sulfites. If you’re super sensitive (dad and I), you’ll react to these. So make sure you get organic tea bags as well!
black tea- check the ingredients. buy loose leaf if possible
green tea- check the ingredients. buy loose leaf if possible
Alcohol – not for the first month. I can kinda handle it, but lots of people can’t.

vodka
bourbon and American Whiskey labeled “straight” whiskey
# Schedule & Routine
Structure and routine are very important in overcoming depression.
- takes your mind of events/issues that may be inducing an episode.
- creates healthy habbits

Communication
-------------
I haven't figured this one out yet.


Managing anger
--------------
As a married man, anger and depression is a big issue for me. When conflict between me and my wife arises, I find it difficult to snap.

# Drugs & Alcohol
Alcohol certainly exagerate feelings of anger.
