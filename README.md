# The Mans Guide to overcoming depression
First of all, the first step is to accept you have a mental illness. I fought this harddd

# Introduction
Looking for resources on the internet, I was unable to find a good strategy to overcoming depression. Now that I know I have depression, it is making it easier to understand my behaviours of the past and identify a path forward. I want to document what may be a more straight forward solution to overcoming depression.  

Most of the self help ressources out there were vague and did not provide a clear path to recovery. Diet, routine and understand the source of your depression will move you forward in overcoming this monster.

# Goals
First and foremost is to overcome depression! 

It is extremely important to have a set of clear goals in order to acheive to grand goal. Even small ones it force you to manifest change in yourself.

- lose weight
- quit smoking
- setup a "allowed" time to endulge in alcohol or marijuna (altho not recommended)

# Signs and Symptoms
My culture in Noterhn Ontario (Sudbury), Canada heavily stigmatized depression and mental illnes. Despite many attempts from my wife that I had a mental illness (bipolar, split personality...which I was epicly offended by) I ignored them and deceived myself that it was just related to martital issues and difficulties in communication.

# Diet
This diet was suggested by Dr. Jordan Peterson. Original can be found here: https://mikhailapeterson.com/2016/12/07/the-list/

## Meats
- turkey
- beef
- chicken
- lamb
- duck
- wild game is fine too, elk, moose, etc.
- wild salmon
- tuna â€“ check the ingredients! Get stuff thatâ€™s just tuna and water and perhaps salt.
- organ meat â€“ chicken liver tastes the best I find
- wild herring â€“ check the ingredients!
- wild sardines â€“ check the ingredients!

## Veggies
- lettuce
- arugula
- arugula microgreens (arugula sprouts)
- cucumber
- swiss chard
- seaweed â€“check the ingredients! this is hard to find without soy and other things. The brand Iâ€™ve linked to is safe and really tasty
- cilantro
- collard greens
- broccoli
- turnips
- cauliflower
- parsnips
- sweet potatoes
- spinach

## Fruit

- olives â€“ check the ingredients! see my olive post. be super careful about which brands you buy here too, many have preservatives and flavours and dyes.
Vinegars:

apple cider vinegar â€“ try to get the organic stuff so there arenâ€™t dyes and flavours added
Oils:

coconut oil â€“ get unrefined. And try to avoid the Nutiva brand. Itâ€™s everywhere but it doesnâ€™t taste as good, and Iâ€™ve had ones that have gone bad before.
olive oil â€“ make sure your olive oil is pure olive oil. Sometimes itâ€™s also soybean oil!
Spices/Seasonings

- salt
- pepper
- marjoram
- parsley
- oregano
- thyme
- rosemary
- peppermint
- turmeric
- basil
- bay leaf
- coriander

## Other

- baking soda (probably wonâ€™t eat this but itâ€™s good for toothpaste ðŸ™‚ )
- peppermint tea â€“ check the ingredients. buy loose leaf (Davidâ€™s sells an organic peppermint which is lovely) or organic. We want to make sure there arenâ€™t preservatives or flavours added. White tea bags or coffee filters are often bleached with sulfites. If youâ€™re super sensitive (dad and I), youâ€™ll react to these. So make sure you get organic tea bags as well!
- black tea- check the ingredients. buy loose leaf if possible
- green tea- check the ingredients. buy loose leaf if possible

## Alcohol â€“ not for the first month. I can kinda handle it, but lots of people canâ€™t.
- vodka (ice tea, fruits)
- bourbon & whiskey (water and ice)
-

## Marijuana
The so called "weed hangover" has returned. I haven't experienced it since high school.

# Sleep
You need a regular sleep routine. In bed before midnight at minimum. Awake @ 7.

# Hygene
- brush your teeth twice a day 
- Shower atleast once a day
- Do not avoid going to the doctor (untreated hemeroids...ya fun right, lol)
- Take pride in how you look (New clothes that fit)

# Schedule & Routine
Structure and routine are very important in overcoming depression.
- takes your mind of events/issues that may be inducing an episode.
- creates healthy habbits

# Fitness
You <b>NEED</b> a fitness routine. The benefits of this will become clear.

##Ideas
- bike riding
- MMA
- 

# Mariage
- Plan a vacation (do everything, treat her)
- Flatter her (hey beautiful, gorgeous)
- Take her to dinner ... plan dates (sushi,keg..gotta keep in line with the diet)
- Buy her stuff....flowers shoes jewlery. (Know her size :) Get her sexy stuff hehe langerie?)
- Spa day (you set it up for her)
- Tell her you love her

## Apology
You may have acted out in many awful ways and your partner likely expects you to offer a sincere apology.

Ideas?

## Communication
I haven't figured this one out yet.
## Intimacy
I need to show my wife more love! Do special things for her.

# Managing anger
As a married man, anger and depression is a big issue for me. When conflict between me and my wife arises, I find it difficult to snap.

# Drugs & Alcohol
Alcohol certainly exagerate feelings of anger.
